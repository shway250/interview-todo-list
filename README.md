## Tech Used
* Node/Express
* Smartsheet SDK
* EJS (Embedded Javascript)
* JQuery

## Methodologies
I started by researching different method for interfacing with the Smartsheet API. This step took me about 45 minutes since I had already familiarized myself with the different kind of sheets I can build using Smartsheet. At first I wanted to use the plain API, but after a bit of experimentation with that I decided the SDK would be faster to develope with. I played around with the idea of building the front end with React, but given the time limit I was under I decided that using a templating language would be a better strategy. Once i had decided on a Node/Express and EJS stack it was just a matter of build out GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE routes one by one. I used a scrum board to organize my tasks.
